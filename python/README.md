# Python Experiments

This repo is a collection of my experiments in Python. Each experiment has no goal other than contributing to the accretion of my Python knowledge.
I strongly believe that knowledge is best attained out of necessity. It's not fun learning a language by exclusively reading. To truly to grasp something you must use it. Sometimes you must use it incorrectly to discover how to use it correctly.

## Ideas for supporting my continued learning

- Keep a log of new Python concepts and factoids.
